# MultiPie Extended Ear Dataset

### Dataset Definition

This dataset was generated from Multi-PIE face dataset [1, 2]. In this repository, we just published image name from Multi-PIE face dataset and detected ear coordinates. You can use face images and corresponding coordinates to obtain ear images.

This dataset is the extended version of [Multi-PIE ear dataset](https://github.com/iremeyiokur/multipie_ear_dataset).

This dataset has been explained and has been used in [our paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/Biometrics/Yaman_Multimodal_Age_and_Gender_Classification_Using_Ear_and_Profile_Face_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf). Please cite it, if it is helpful for you.
